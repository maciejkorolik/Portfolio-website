### Simple one-page site that can be used as a template for personal website or portfolio.

It was my first "finished" web development project done after some time of learning HTML, CSS and JS.

Website is fully responsive and was coded with "mobile-first" methodology. It uses Flexbox and CSS grid.

Most of the site was done with pure HTML and CSS, only one simple script was written in JS to allow functionality of the menu in mobile versions.

It is done more as a template rather than full site, therefore all texts and images are just placeholders.
